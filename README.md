# RISC-V_PQC_Project
Post-quantum cryptography implementation on RISC-V



To Do

1. [] Conduct literature search, read up on FIPS 203, 204, 205
2. [] Set up report structure, create time-plan (Gantt-diagram)
3. [] Evaluate algorithms based on VPR/Nordic specific use case
4. [] Benchmark algorithm implementations, find areas to be accelerated/find bottlenecks
5. [] RTL implementation?
